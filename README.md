PROBLEM STATEMENT

Transform agricultural practices by creating an interactive forum for farmers to be able to access information and ask questions to improve and enhance agricultural practices & output

One of the main reasons for crisis in agriculture is lack of timely and quality farm extension services.In absensce of quality extension, the farmers are dependant on local input dealers. Costs of extensive services are also becoming prohibitive and givernemnet is withdrawing from them.



SOLUTION:

We propose to develop an online/offline application which can be accesssible over mobile phonees for farmers and field level functionaries to have easy access to to knowledge, ost their queries and solve their day to day problems around sustaible farming.
